# STM-C-Distance-Measurement
Distance Measurement with a switch, C code using STM IDE and STM32f4 board
Used a HCSR04 distance ultrasonic distance sensor in the breadbord with a switch, 7segment display and 4 LEDs.
LEDs either turn on and off or blink depending on the distance and 7segment displays the instant distance of the object from the sensor in centimeters.
The code is in the txt file, if you want to make it work create a new project on STMCUBE32 IDE and change the core and ioc files with the ones i provided.
