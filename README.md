# STM-C-Distance-Measurement
Distance Measurement with a switch, C code using STM IDE and STM32f4 board
Used a HCSR04 distance ultrasonic distance sensor in the breadbord with a switch, 7segment display and 4 LEDs.
LEDs either turn on and off or blink depending on the distance and 7segment displays the instant distance of the object from the sensor in centimeters.
